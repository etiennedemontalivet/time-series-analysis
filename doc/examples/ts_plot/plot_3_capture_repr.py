Capturing output representations
================================

This example demonstrates how the configuration ``capture_repr``
(:ref:`capture_repr`) works. The default ``capture_repr`` setting is
``capture_repr: ('_repr_html_', '__repr__')`` and was used when building the
Sphinx-Gallery documentation. The output that is captured with this setting
is demonstrated in this example. Differences in outputs that would be captured
with other ``capture_repr`` settings is also explained.
