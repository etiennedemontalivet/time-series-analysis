Datasets
=========

The framework uses mainly dataframes.

**Raw data** have to be formatted using dataframes, indexes being the filenames of
corresponding sensor's acquisitions, columns being the temporality (non column names needed).

**Features data** have to be formatted using dataframes, indexes being the filenames of
corresponding sensor's acquisitions, columns being features names.
